# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** using Machine Learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
The system recommends movies based on similarity between movie features such as:
- Genres
- Overview
- Cast
- Director
- Keywords

We use **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** and **Cosine Similarity** to compute similarity between movies.
